## Chat-to-Canvas Auto-Workflow Feature

**The flagship capability: every chat message automatically generates and applies a workflow on the canvas, including full node configs.**

### How It Works

1. User types in the left chat panel (e.g. "Build a bulk email campaign with cadence")
2. Message + current canvas state (all node IDs, kinds, configs) is sent to the LLM
3. LLM returns a JSON patch: `{ add_nodes, add_edges, update_nodes, remove_node_ids }`
4. Frontend applies the patch instantly — nodes appear on canvas with full config pre-filled
5. Right panel auto-opens on the last added node so the user can review/adjust config
6. A badge on the assistant message confirms what changed ("Canvas updated: +4 nodes")

### Implementation Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `apps/api/champiq_api/routers/chat.py` | SYSTEM_PROMPT with full config schemas per node kind; LLM call; patch extraction |
| `apps/web/src/lib/applyPatch.ts` | `applyWorkflowPatch()` — single source of truth for all canvas mutations from LLM |
| `apps/web/src/components/layout/ChatPanel.tsx` | Chat UI; calls API; applies patch; auto-selects last added node |
| `apps/web/src/components/canvas/ToolNode.tsx` | Node rendering; config summary display; kind-specific colors |
| `apps/web/src/components/layout/RightPanel.tsx` | Node inspector; structured config form per kind |
| `apps/web/src/store/canvasStore.ts` | Zustand store; `updateNodeConfig()`; `setSelectedNode()` |

### Node Config Auto-population

The system prompt embeds the **complete config schema** for every node kind so the LLM always generates fully-populated configs. The LLM is instructed to:
- Never return `"config": {}` — always fill all fields
- Use the user's existing workflow JSON to generate `update_nodes` (not re-add existing nodes)
- Position nodes in a left-to-right horizontal chain (x += 280 per step)

### Layout Algorithm

Nodes are placed **linearly left-to-right**:
- First node at x=80, y=300
- Each subsequent node: x += 280 from the rightmost existing node
- Branch paths (if/switch/split) use y offsets specified by the LLM (±150)
- Implemented in `applyPatch.ts` → `linearPosition()`

### Auto-select Behavior

After every AI patch is applied, the **last added node** is auto-selected, opening the RightPanel config form so the user can immediately review and edit its configuration.

### Chat History Replay

On page load, chat history is fetched from the DB and each assistant message re-applies its patch exactly once (tracked by `patchApplied = useRef(false)` per bubble) to reconstruct the canvas state.

### Status: ✅ Implemented (April 2026)

## ChampMail Integration

**Major architectural change (2026-04-29):** ChampMail is now an **inline module** inside ChampIQ — not an external service. The legacy VPS-hosted ChampMail at `10.10.21.19:8000` was unreachable from Railway (private-IP range) so the entire send/sequence/event pipeline was absorbed into the ChampIQ API. Email transport is delegated to **Emelia (https://emelia.io)** via GraphQL; reply detection is via Emelia webhooks.

See `ChampMail_Inline_Spec.md` for the architecture, data model, and remaining items.

| Capability | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| add_prospect | ✅ | Local Postgres `champmail_prospects` |
| start_sequence / enroll_sequence | ✅ | Idempotent — re-enroll returns existing |
| pause_sequence / resume_sequence | ✅ | Working-hours aware on resume |
| send_single_email | ✅ | Round-robin sender pool, daily caps enforced |
| get_analytics | ✅ | Aggregated from `champmail_events` |
| list_templates / get_template / preview_template | ✅ | Jinja2 sandbox renderer |
| create_template / create_sequence / add_sequence_step | ✅ | New local-only canvas actions |
| Reply classification (champmail_reply) | ✅ | Rewired to local services on 2026-04-29 |
| Credential gate enforcement | ⚠ | Single-tenant — credentials no longer required for `champmail` actions; chat.py system prompt still asks for them but it's a no-op. Cleanup pending. |
| Webhook-driven event ingestion | ✅ | `POST /api/champmail/webhooks/emelia` with HMAC verify; auto-pauses on reply/bounce/unsubscribe |
| Cadence engine | ✅ | APScheduler tick every 60s; processes due enrollments in batches of 200 |
| Idempotent sends | ✅ | sha1(enrollment_id, step_index) UNIQUE constraint |
| Signed unsubscribe links | ✅ | HMAC-signed token, footer auto-injected by SendService |
| Sender bounce auto-disable | ✅ | After 5 consecutive bounces |
| Tools HTTP route `/api/tools/champmail/{action}` | ✅ | Routes to local executor (no driver) |
| Frontend Prospects/Templates/Senders panels | ❌ | Phase 6 — backend ready, UI not yet built |

|----|------|--------|-------|
| UC-11 | Daily Cron → list prospects → call each (ChampVoice) | ✅ | Workflow #39 on production. Click "Activate" in TopBar to register cron. |
| UC-12 | Webhook → create prospect → immediate call | ✅ | Workflow #37. Inbound: POST /api/webhooks/wf/37/trigger-webhook-lead. Live call to +919098474926 verified. |
| UC-13 | Manual → get_prospect_status → switch → call hot / track cold | ✅ | Workflow #38. Switch routing verified: replied/opened → call, cold/not_found → LinkedIn. |

---

## Cron Activation (fixed 2026-04-28)

The canvas "Run All" only fires ad-hoc executions — cron nodes on the canvas are not registered with APScheduler until the workflow is saved as an active persistent workflow.

**Solution:** "Activate" button (CalendarClock icon) in the TopBar:
- Extracts `trigger.cron` nodes from the canvas
- Creates/updates a `WorkflowTable` row with `active=True` and `triggers` array
- APScheduler calls `CronScheduler.sync()` → jobs registered automatically
- Button turns green and shows "Active" after activation

---

## Duplicate Node Fix (fixed 2026-04-28)

`applyPatch.ts` now deduplicates nodes and edges: if the LLM patch `add_nodes` an ID that already exists, it merges the config instead of creating a second copy. Edge deduplication uses a Map by ID. Previously canvas accumulated 72 nodes with many duplicates.

---

## Credential Manager (upgraded 2026-04-28)

CredentialManager now supports multiple types with type-appropriate fields:
- **champmail** — email + password (also used for ChampGraph)
- **champvoice** — elevenlabs_api_key + agent_id + phone_number_id
- **http_bearer** — token
- **http_basic** — username + password

---

## Known Issues / Blockers

| Issue | Severity | Detail |
|-------|----------|--------|
| ChampMail SMTP sending blocked | High | test@accountsonline.biz password wrong. Correct credentials needed from mail server admin. |
| ChampGraph create_prospect credential | Medium | Needs champmail-admin credential on production to create prospects via API. |

---

| Undo/redo for canvas mutations | Medium | History stack in Zustand |
| Template library | Medium | Pre-built workflow templates selectable from chat |
| Canvas auto-fit after patch | Low | Zoom to show newly added nodes |
| Multi-user / team canvases | Low | Per-user sessions, shared team canvases |
